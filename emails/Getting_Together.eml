For our biz meeting in SC, the best times would be Monday Sept 8th late aft=
ernoon/early evening while Mark is at his yoga class, followed by dinner wi=
th Mark and ???

Or, sometime on the 9th.  Mark and I are also plotting a gathering of the "=
leading ladies of organic" in S.C. -- you, Laura, Zea, and Brice.  Not sure=
 it will work, but one way oir another, we will get together.

I will submit LOI in next 24 hrs, and report on M2M progress will be in you=
r hands also within a day (and Michael's).

Sorry about rush, about to close plane door.
