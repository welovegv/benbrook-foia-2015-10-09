Without looking up the numbers and giving you precise data, the reasons are=
 clear.  First, PEAS numbers are a composite of five indices, of which bees=
 is one.  Given how its used in grape production, imidacloprid scores relat=
ively low on the other 4 indices.

Second, imidacloprid granulars have a Use Pattern Adjustment Factor that re=
flects the absence of foliar exposures. The actual score for imidacloprid w=
ill differ hugely between the liquid/foliar, in season sprays and pre- or a=
t-plant granulars, because resulting exposure profiles change so much.  I r=
ecall that given the way Lodi grape growers use it, Use Pattern Adjustment =
Factors bring down the score.  Ditto in the Wisconsin program, where the gr=
anular use pattern scroes about 3/4 lower than the liquid.

PEAS has never been applied to seed treatments, and if/when it is, imidaclo=
prid would take a big hit re exposures via pollan/nectar.  Let me know if y=
ou need more detail.
