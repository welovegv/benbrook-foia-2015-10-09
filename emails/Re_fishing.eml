   Well, I suppose the news from the doc is good in one way.  Going and sho=
oting an elk does not sound fully conducive to back care.

   Thanks for coming by, I think we made a good collective decision.

      Hey Chuck,
      Guess you are being shot out of the saddle all the way around. Since =
Deane doesn=92t feel well, Doc is going to stay and help him
      try to get his elk on Saturday and Sunday.
      He said that he would like to go fish up there either later on or nex=
t year but would want to go and fish for 2-3 days, not just
      one day. So maybe you guys can work up a trip at a later date. His ph=
one # 928-715-7427.

      Also we heard back from the Doctor who told Deane to get back on his =
pain meds and give it more time. He didn=92t think any-
      thing was wrong.....just a long time healing and someone who expects =
too much too soon. He told him ANY activity was going
      to bother and irritate his back for a while yet.
