I received the below request from Franklin Egan, the ARS scientist working =
with us on the organic transitions proposal.  He is interesting in doing so=
me work with the correlation study dataset, and could in fact help us get t=
he second paper done.  Is it o.k. For me to send him the data and interact =
with him as he uses it?  I fully support this move.

Hello Chuck,



Good to talk with you this afternoon. Thank you for telling me about the Or=
ganic Valley Milk/Forage Correlation Study. I am wondering if if might be p=
ossible for me to look at some of the datasets involved in that research? A=
s I mentioned, my project with ARS involves estimating the land use footpri=
nt of organic versus conventional dairies and quantifying the land resource=
s available in the Northeast to do pasture-based dairying at a regional sca=
le. For this research, I need to come up with estimates of rations and prod=
uction for organic/pasture-based dairies, and it sounds like the correlatio=
n study could be an excellent resource for this. Any work I do with this da=
ta would add to publications coming out of the Correlation Study and also p=
rovide preliminary support for the OREI transitions proposal we are working=
 on. Please let me know if I might be able to look at the Organic Valley da=
taset and incorporate it into my research.



Kind Regards,



Franklin Egan
