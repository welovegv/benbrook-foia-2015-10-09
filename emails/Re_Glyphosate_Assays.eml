        What assay will you be doing in urine and blood, how sensitive and =
reliable is it?  I assume its more sensitive/reliable than the one used in =
Aris et al?

        Have you thought about contacting the Quebec team to see if they ha=
ve any frozen blood samples that you could re-test?
