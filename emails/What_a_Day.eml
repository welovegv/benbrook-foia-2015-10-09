        Hope we can get together for Monday night football.  I fished my as=
s off, nothing but 3 little bumps.  Dave Flynn is asleep on the deck, with =
a big smile on his face.  Hope your elk hunting went well.

        I am ready to declare the seahawks out of it.  Lousy offensive game=
 calling, looked like the Obama admin.
