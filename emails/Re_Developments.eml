With all you have to do, thanks for taking the time to do this message.  I =
am sure you are right; I have been writing foundation proposals my whole ca=
reer, not gov't grants.  I still worry a bit re whether panels will see "me=
thodological improvements" of the sort M2M might take on as really importan=
t.  I guess we will find out over time.

I also think I need to volunteer for a panel, to gain a better feel for the=
 process.  I would do BioAg, but I will be applying this cycle, so that won=
't work.  I assume if you serve on an AFRI panel, you can still apply to ot=
her program areas.

I do hope you appreciate the dilemma I face.  The people/companies who are =
funding my work expect to see successes like PLOS ONE and BJN, and these su=
ccesses will obviously raise the odds M2M will get a third year of $$ from =
the four founding investors.  I spent 3 months this year writing failed NIF=
A grant proposals, time that could have produced 2 more big papers, which w=
ill still come, just much later. Despite not having an extension appointmen=
t, I spend a ton of time doing classic extension work. And then I also have=
 to worry about making a living.

Hi Chuck.



The days, weeks and months are blowing by and I can=92t keep up. It already=
 feels like Wednesday was ancient history. I did notice that you had a good=
 chat with Moyer.



Regarding the fundraising / grant issues =85 I=92m not convinced that you d=
on=92t have a chance with USDA yet =96 if I thought that I would have couns=
eled you against joining WSU to create M2M. I think it=92s more about figur=
ing out the game and the angle that will bring you success. A few bullet po=
ints of suggestions follow =96 and we can discuss these more:



1.       There is a stark difference between a successful proposal to a com=
pany / foundation and one to a science panel. The former seem to be sold on=
 the big picture and vision, whereas the later are sold on the novelty / un=
iqueness of the scientific contribution. The science panel is much less con=
cerned about the application (or your big picture findings) and much more c=
oncerned about the methodological developments you can achieve. Scientific =
reviewers care more about the widget you build, and less about what you lea=
rn from using the widget. While the readership numbers from your articles a=
re impressive, a lot of scientists don=92t care about that as much as they =
care about what advancement you=92ve made that they can build on =96 citati=
ons are more important to success in grants.

2.       I would highly encourage you to apply for a BIOAg grant this fall.=
 The purpose of this program is to seed new ideas and help you get enough p=
reliminary work done to prove to a scientific review panel that you have a =
methodology that could be meaningful. Our success rate is tight (20% last r=
ound), but not as tight as USDA (5%) =96 and our =93template=94 has been de=
signed to get you to hone down the methodological argument in a way that ma=
tches well with what USDA panels are looking for. It=92s not by chance that=
 we=92ve had so much success with BIOAg recipients hitting USDA OREI, OTS, =
SCRI, Climate and Bioenergy. The most common criticism of a proposal to the=
 BIOAg Program is that the PI spent too much time discussing the big pictur=
e and not enough time telling us exactly what they think they can do and wh=
y it=92s innovative.

3.       I would strongly encourage you to take the route of playing the =
=93bit role=94 on someone else=92s grant. Several of us have floated progra=
m budgets in this manner =96 and for many of us this is effectively how we =
=93buy our Nick Potter=94 leaving money for the other capacities that we ne=
ed to the bigger pots (for me this is Georgine, for Claudio Stockle it=92s =
his programmer). For instance, I=92m a PI / co-PI on [I think] 7 competitiv=
e grants right now, plus I have a little bit of funding that I=92ve banked =
from past grants. In my case, only 2 of the 7 projects are =93major investm=
ents=94 of my effort =96the others are all largely projects I=92m just play=
ing the bit role. However, when you look at my overall budget, those =93bit=
 roles=94 are 1=8E2 the pool of money.

4.       The other thing that being a co-PI on does for you is it builds yo=
ur credentials. I know that Reganold counseled you to focus on the journal =
papers =96 as that is a big part of building a reputation. However, being a=
 =93USDA funded scientist=94 is just as important and maybe more important.=
 Our recently named Provost often said =93anyone can get published these da=
ys, but you have to be special to get federal competitive funding=94. Scien=
ce panel reviewers look at CV=92s and =93current and pending=94 forms =96 a=
nd they=92re looking for whether you=92re =93on the dole=94. Playing a bit =
role builds your credibility to secure the big one.

5.       When you write a proposal to a science panel, the most important t=
hing to keep in the back of your mind is =93who is my biggest scientific cr=
itic and why won=92t they like my proposal?=94 Chances are that person is t=
he lead reviewer (or at least a very important ad hoc reviewer) for your pr=
oposal. One unfavorable review sinks a proposal every time. On the other ha=
nd, if you convince your nemesis you have a good idea, you=92re going to ge=
t funded.

6.       In a pool of 200 proposals where 10 will be funded, reviewers are =
looking for reasons to drop proposals. Perfection is essential. Many of us =
are willing to review and give you comments =96 but we need to have a draft=
 well in advance of submission.

7.       I hear from everyone that serving on a panel, ad hoc reviewing, an=
d grantsmanship workshops are essential for success. I have personally seen=
 this work =96 where CSANR LT members submit much better proposals after se=
rving on a BIOAg panel than before =96 and it leads to funding internal and=
 externally. I can help cover the cost of grantsmanship training if you thi=
nk that you can do this.

8.       Resubmit, resubmit, resubmit. The faculty that are consistently su=
ccessful resubmit an average of 3 times.



Thanks,

Chad

                Chad --



                Sorry we had no time to visit in Dayton.  The event was goo=
d, despite the heat.



                The release of the BJN paper has been a remarkable success.=
  Eric Sorensen did a masterful job, as always, and has been pleasantly sur=
prised by the extent of coverage.  Nic did a great job developing the mater=
ial on the website, the blog has gotten lots of attention, and I am sure th=
ere will be some interesting, further ramifications.



                I attach an accounting of the media thus far =97 370,000,00=
0 circulation of media outlets covering the study, about 1/3 in the UK and =
Europe.  The total reach of the PLOS ONE milk paper, 7 months after release=
, is 420 million, so this one will top it by a wide margin.  There are many=
, many stories still to come in weekly/monthly magazines, more radio, and w=
ho knows what else.  All in all, the coverage was good.  The bickering over=
 antioxidants was to be expected, but I think we responded to it well.



                The cross-Atlantic cooperation was excellent, and everyone =
is looking forward to round 2 when the animal product meta-analysis comes o=
ut late this year, early next year.  We are going to the same journal, and =
are adding papers through the end of 2013 =97 so that includes our PLOS ONE=
 milk paper.



                On the $$ front, we have been turned down on the first two =
NIFA proposals =97 BRAG/alfalfa (expected) and organic transitions/dairy (o=
ur best shot, only medium priority; 2 excellent reviews, one weird one).  H=
ave two more proposals pending, one with the NOP and one with the RWJF.  Di=
sappointing outcome thus far.  Based on the reaction to the AFRI proposals,=
 I really doubt there is much chance for my kind of work to get funding via=
 AFRI.  I could be a bit player in a bigger grant lead by others, but I do =
not see the panels ever considering the sort of work M2M does as important =
as the lab and applied field work they support.  I do think we will have su=
ccess with foundations in the next few years, and that is where I intend to=
 focus in the next 6 months.



                The short-term budget crunch is subsiding.  The $35k from T=
OC/OTA to work on pesticide residues is in, or soon will be (they addressed=
 the check wrong the first time).  The Ceres $$ is in, or soon will be, but=
 I have to discuss an alternative budget with them.  Once that is done, and=
 successfully I hope, we are ok for almost 24 months at current spending =
=97 but me on 1/2 time/pay has to end well before that.



                I am pretty sure the core funders are all in for a third ye=
ar.  I am, however, growing more and more concerned about whether I can rai=
se the $$ to make this program grow.  Nic is great and a huge asset, but M2=
M needs 3-4 PhD level people to meaningful do what we set out to do.  I don=
't see how we get from here to there without one big grant that does not re=
quire a ton of work to raise/manage.  I have no idea where such $$ might co=
me from, but I still think Gates is one of the most likely places.
