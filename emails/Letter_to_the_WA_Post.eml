We had 200 words to work with per email from Elizabeth (limit was really 25=
0).  Shorter is always better. Here is what was submitted by Don and I.  Re=
ceipt by the Post already acknowledged.

Please accept the following letter.  The signatories are two of five co-aut=
hors on a paper published December 6, 2013 in PLOS ONE.  Tamar Haspel's pie=
ce in the "Health Section" of today's paper addressed, and challenged some =
of our findings.  We had several positive and professional exchanges with T=
amar as her piece came together, but we still feel it unfairly characterize=
s key aspects of our study and findings.

Tamar Haspel=92s piece in the January 27 Health Section covered our finding=
s of increased omega-3 fatty acids in organic dairy products. Our study als=
o highlighted the ratio of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids  in milk fat, an=
d showed that this ratio falls from a relatively healthy level of 5.7 in co=
nventional to an even healthier 2.3 in organic dairy products.



Haspel notes several reasons for buying organic milk, but on the question o=
f the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio, she quotes only scientists who believe the =
ratio is unimportant.  As we noted in several exchanges with Ms. Haspel, ot=
her scientists conclude that this ratio is a useful indicator of the health=
fulness of fat in foods and diets. Plus, most scientists support the need t=
o increase omega-3 intakes.



We agree with Haspel that ounce-for-ounce, other foods have higher concentr=
ations of omega-3 fatty acids than do dairy products (e.g., salmon, flaxsee=
d, and walnuts). But because dairy products are consumed in far larger amou=
nts on nearly a daily basis, they make important contributions to the overa=
ll supply of omega-3 fatty acids in the American diet.  For this reason, mi=
lk and dairy products can help consumers move toward a healthier balance in=
 overall fat intakes.
