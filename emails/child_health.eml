You can call me anytime this week, Friday is fine.  I am intrigued with you=
r background and interests.  I do not have available funds though to suppor=
t your PhD, although am working now to raise more.  Perhaps you have a line=
 on a fellowship?

   Dear Chuck,

   I apologize for my dilatory response, as I have been consumed by doctora=
l program applications. Luckily, applications have allowed me to further sh=
arpen and articulate my research interests moving forward, particularly giv=
en my research and teaching background.  I am happy to discuss them during =
our upcoming phone call. What days/times work best for you typically? Frida=
y mornings seem to be the most flexible time, personally.

   As revealed in my attached CV, the research process sparked my interest =
during my undergraduate career. That being said, while I have extensive qua=
litative and quantitative research experience hailing back to 2007, I want =
to learn a specific set of research skills that I need in order to a) discr=
iminate between contradictory findings about GMOs and health in the peer re=
viewed literature, and b) conduct my own rigorous, objective, and independe=
nt research on the effects of (new) biotechnology on human health. I am con=
fident that I can learn these skills under your tutelage, Chuck.

   I am grateful that Dr. Huber has recommended I reach out to you, given o=
ur matching scholarly interests, and I look forward to your correspondence.



   All my best,
   <Rodriguez_CV_10.19.14.pdf>
