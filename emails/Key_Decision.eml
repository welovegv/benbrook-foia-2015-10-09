George and Theresa --

I am making good progress on the first proposal to USDA, to the Organic Tra=
nsitions program.  In short, it is "Correlation Study #2," bigger and bette=
r.  One issue needs to be settled immediately =97 is this an OV only/centri=
c project, or do I try to recruit some help/farmers/support from Horizon an=
d/or other processors?  The odds of funding will be enhanced somewhat if no=
t solely OV.  But the time/path to get others involved is by no means assur=
ed.

Please advise one way or the other.

Chuck
