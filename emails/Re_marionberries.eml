      There are two main types of blackberries-erect, and trailing (dew ber=
ries). Although there are Thorny and Thorn-less and Hybrid. In this case we=
 are just talking about the two main types. When properly pruned the erect =
varieties don't usually need to be trellised, but trailing varieties must b=
e trellised. Construct a trellis of posts spaced 10 to 15 feet apart, with =
wires attached at 3 and 5 foot heights. The plants are then attached to the=
se wires with soft string.

   Planting

      Set blackberry plants at the same depth as they were grown at the nur=
sery. Space erect varieties 3 to 5 feet apart in a row, and trailing types =
6 feet apart. Allow 10 to 12 feet between rows for working and picking. You=
 can use hardwood mulch or rice whole. Please, DO NOT use Pine shavings( we=
 ship with) or any other acoidic mulch. And always leave 1 foot Mulch free =
spot around plant base. The lateral shoots should also be tipped back to a =
length of 18 to 20 inches.  Suckers which develop between the rows should b=
e pulled up, not cut out. Cutting off a sucker does not delay its re -growt=
h much. After removing the fruited canes at harvest time, thin the other pl=
ants so that there is only one plant for every 10 inches in a row. Please, =
send e-mail for more information about pruning and trellising.

      One of the most important advances in the blackberry industry was the=
 development of thorn-less varieties, which need to be trellised. New shoot=
s are tied to the wires with soft string as they grow. Pruning is fairly si=
mple since you keep only 4 to 8 canes per plant. All weak canes and suckers=
 are removed.

   Harvest

      Most gardeners don't leave blackberries on the vine long enough to de=
velop properly. When harvested too early the berries are sour. Ripe fruit l=
ose their shiny color and start to turn a dull black. As with raspberries, =
fruit should be picked in the morning in a sunny day for better quality and=
 more sugar content.
