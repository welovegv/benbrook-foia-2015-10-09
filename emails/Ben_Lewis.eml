        Nic has found an excellent computer specialist/helper, and we have =
used him for some hourly work, paid by me directly.  We need to get him ont=
o M2M money.  In Cindy=92s absence, is there some way you can help Nic get =
whatever paperwork done that is needed.  He is an hourly employee, works fo=
r $20/hr (a bargain).

        The same scenario applies to Sonia, I need to establish a temporary=
 position for her, so we can determine whether she is the right person for =
a full time position.
