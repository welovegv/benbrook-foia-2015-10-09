Zea --

This is the best thing I have ever read on the topic of bullying in the pub=
lic commons.  Incredibly good work.  It has inspired me to do something I h=
ave wanted to for years, and I promise to not use any bullying tactics in a=
ccomplishing the ultimate goal.

Please friends and trusted colleagues cc'ed on this message, if you have no=
t read Zea's powerful blog, do so now --
http://fruitiliciousfarm.weebly.com/blog

Plus, I ask a favor or you.  If you know of someone that has been bullied o=
ver an issue before the NOSB, or the organic community as a whole, by anyon=
e, please send me a private email with this information.  I am not sure wha=
t I will do with it, but I suspect once the leaves scatter on the floor, so=
me path will present itself.
