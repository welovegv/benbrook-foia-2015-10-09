The comment period on Dow's registration petition for the choline salt form=
ulation of 2,4-D =97 developed for use on 2,4-D herbicide-tolerant corn =97=
 closed 6/30/14.  Many thousands of comments where submitted.  I usually do=
 not do comments as a private citizen, but feel very strongly that the next=
-generation of multi-HT crops will be triply bad for US ag, the environment=
, and public health.  So I explained why and suggested what EPA should do, =
if they go down this path, as nearly everyone expects.

I did a blog introducing my comments; the full text of the comments submitt=
ed to the EPA docket is accessible via a link in the body of the blog.

Genetically Modified 'Super-Bananas' Are Being Tested in the US

A genetically modified "super-banana" is going up for clinical market trial=
s in the US. But the fruit was in fact engineered for Uganda, with the goal=
 of getting Ugandans some extra vitamin A.

James Dale is the director of the Centre for Tropical Crops and Biocommodit=
ies at Queensland University of Technology, Australia. Since 2005, Dale has=
 been experimenting with pumping up the amount of vitamin A in the East Afr=
ican Highland cooking banana. He told Scientific American that =93Roughly 1=
5 to 30 percent of the Ugandan population under 5 and women of childbearing=
 age suffer from a [vitamin A] deficiency.=94

The humble banana is actually sort of the perfect food to fortify with more=
 vitamins: They already have some beta carotene, which is a nutrient that t=
he body uses to produce vitamin A. Varieties of bananas that are native to =
Papua New Guinea have even more beta carotene, to the point of being both o=
range like carrots, and by all accounts unpleasant to eat.

But the good news was that Dale and his team only had to weave in genetic m=
aterial from the beta-carotene rich Papua New Guinea bananas into their Eas=
t African Highland cousin. "This gene we isolated and put in our super-bana=
nas is a banana gene, and it always has been," Dale said. "We simply toned =
down its influence."

As Jennifer Huizen explains in her excellent Scientific American article, t=
he other reason the East African Highlands banana is an ideal vitamin vesse=
l is that Ugandans love them. =93In fact, many receive 30 percent of their =
daily caloric intake from them,=94 Huizen wrote, =93eating three to 11 bana=
nas daily, or roughly 500 to 800 pounds annually.=94

So: you have a country with a vitamin deficiency, and a silver bullet in th=
e form of a GM banana that has 10 times the vitamin A potential of Bananas =
Classic. The only real problem is that GM foods can't legally be sold in Ug=
anda. Ugandans remain leery of lab-altered food, just like pretty much ever=
yone else.

The situation isn't too different from one in the Philippines, although the=
re, the modified staple food was called =93golden rice.=94 Though 4.4 milli=
on Filipino children were thought to be vitamin A deficient, according to t=
he World Health Organization, the vitamin A-rich rice was delayed for 12 ye=
ars by anti-GM-food anxiety.

And it doesn't even have to be the spectre of =93genetic modification=94 th=
at could sink the super-banana. Huizen mentions the fia banana as an exampl=
e of what seemed to be the perfect fruit falling short of expectations. In =
the early 2000s, the fia banana, which has a =93massive yield,=94 was trans=
planted to East Africa. The people didn't like the color or texture of the =
fia, and virutally no one is eating fia bananas in East Africa today.

The day of reckoning for the super-banana is still fairly far off, with sci=
entific and legislative hurdles yet to overcome. Still, the GM banana has c=
aught the attention of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and its consid=
erable resources. It's going to take more than a sense of disquiet at the p=
rospect of =93GM fruit=94 to stop the super banana from at least having a s=
hot.
