Here are some windows for next week, will any of these work for you?

*       Tue Sep 9, 9am to 11am PT/ 11-1pm CT or 1 to 2pm PT/3 to 4pm CT

Thanks much
Best,
Matthew

   Good afternoon,


   Thanks Chuck and all for both the detailed and big-picture comments. I w=
ill work to incorporate the suggested edits into the policy and process doc=
uments. WFM is ready to start the conversation about residue testing and wo=
uld like to have a clear plan in place by Oct 15th. On my work list is draf=
ting a one/two page summary of the need/benefit for a residue testing progr=
am and getting it to you for review Chuck.  I hope to have the first draft =
ready next week.

   We have requests from 3 growers (a total of 4 requests) for exceptions t=
o the current prohibited lists, attached here.  We have carefully researche=
d each of the requests and created draft recommendations, within each you w=
ill find an executive summary, description of the target pest/pesticide use=
 case in agriculture, a review of environmental and dietary risks, a review=
 of alternatives and mitigation measures, an ipmprime.com<http://ipmprime.c=
om> analysis (where possible) and finally a copy of the application submitt=
ed by the grower at the bottom of the document.

   What's at stake for the growers?

   Naturipe -- If the exception is not granted, any treated blueberries wil=
l be unrated.  If granted their blueberries will be eligible to earn only a=
 Good rating, they will be barred from Better or Best while using the reque=
sted pesticides.

   EARTH -- If the exception is not granted, any treated bananas will be un=
rated. If granted their bananas will be eligible to earn any rating.  None =
of their requested pesticides are prohibited due to dietary risk, only beca=
use they are not US-EPA approved.

   Kings River -- If the exception is not granted, any treated citrus will =
be unrated.  If granted their citrus will be eligible to earn only a Good r=
ating, they will be barred from Better or Best while using the requested pe=
sticides.

   What do we need from you?

   A call time in the next days to discuss these documents and get your inp=
ut on our recommendations. If you find yourself working on it and have thou=
ghts to share in advance, please feel free to share with the group via emai=
l.  Let's find a time to get on the phone together to address any questions=
/comments, suggestions that work for Tom and include:

   Tues 7 to 9 am PT/9to11 CT, or after 130PT/330 CT

   Wed 7 to 9 am PT/9to11 CT, or after 100PT/300 CT

   Thurs all day

   Friday after 10amPT/ 12noonCT

   The chlorpyrifos/citrus request for Kings River in California was an eme=
rgency request we received Weds and therefore owe WFM a recommendation Tues=
day afternoon.  In the likely event that we don't get a call time before Tu=
esday at 12noon please provide any input that would impact our recommendati=
on, which as you can see is to not grant the exception, via email, or feel =
free to call Tom or me.

   Thanks very much,
   Be well
   Matthew
