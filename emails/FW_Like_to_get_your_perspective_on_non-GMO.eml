Subject: Like to get your perspective on non-GMO



Hello Dr. Benbrook;



My name is Jack Southworth. I am an eastern Oregon cattle rancher and curre=
ntly Chairman of Country Natural Beef.  CNB is a cooperative of cattle ranc=
hers who produce branded beef products.  We are GAP certified and last year=
 we introduced, in some of our retail customers=92 stores, beef that uses n=
on-GMO feeds in the final feedlot finishing phase.  We are considering prod=
ucing beef that is non-GMO for the life of the animal and that is causing s=
ome division in our ranks.



For a better explanation of what we=92re dealing with  I=92ve pasted below =
a copy of an e-mail I sent to our 60 or 70 members yesterday which, by the =
way, references a blog you wrote last summer on the discovery of some RR Wh=
eat in eastern Oregon in which I thought you made some very good points:



Hello CNB Members;



I think a lot about the non-GMO issue and how it is going to affect CNB, we=
 ranchers and our customers.  To be honest, I thought when I researched the=
 issue I would come up with good guys and bad guys; a right side of this is=
sue and a wrong side.  We CNB members could then get on the =91right=92 sid=
e of the issue ecologically, socially and economically. The only problem is=
 I=92m not finding a =91wrong=92 side.  Both sides are compelling and, in m=
y mind, need to be respected.

Farmers that use GMO seed =96 including some CNB members - are not doing so=
 just because it is more profitable but because they can reduce tillage and=
 herbicide usage and reduce the use of more toxic herbicides which is good =
for their land and their families.

Folks who want non-GMO foods are not doing so to vilify big business as muc=
h as they just want to make sure they are providing healthy food for their =
families. They feel the jury is still out on the safety to humans and lives=
tock of GMO foods.

                What can CNB do?  Presently, we can provide an option, a ch=
oice for our customers by providing beef fed non-GMO feeds in the final fee=
dlot finishing phase. New Seasons Market wrote in a flyer for their meat ma=
nagers and CNB ranchers, =93(New Seasons Market) was founded on the fundame=
ntal principal of choice.  New Seasons Market is a one-stop store for both =
Frosted Flakes and Free-Range Chicken.=94  CNB should feel good about being=
 able to provide a choice as well.

                As CNB and its member ranchers researches the feasibility o=
f going non-GMO for the life of the animal one person we might seek for adv=
ice is Dr. Chuck Benbrook who heads WSU=92s Center for Sustaining Agricultu=
re and Natural Resources.  His profile on WSU=92s website says, =93He serve=
s as the leader of the new CSANR program Measure to Manage=85.The goal of M=
2M is to develop, refine, validate, and apply analytical systems quantifyin=
g the impacts of farming systems, technology, and policy on food nutritiona=
l quality, food safety, agricultural productivity, economic performance alo=
ng food value chains, and on natural resources and the environment.=94 That=
 sounds to me like someone who would be looking out for both consumers and =
ranchers.

                In July of 2013, Dr Benbrook wrote a blog (http://csanr.wsu=
.edu/independent-science-ge-food ) about the finding of some Roundup Ready =
wheat plants last summer in eastern Oregon.  He wrote, =93Some good could c=
ome of it if it triggers a fresh look at why skepticism and/or opposition t=
o genetically engineered (GE) foods is growing in the U.S.=94

                Dr. Benbrook surmises that one reason for the skepticism ma=
y be =93the growing lack of confidence in our GE crop and food regulatory s=
ystem=94 and goes on to note that most GE research is not conducted by the =
U.S. government and =93that GE crop approvals are based largely on industry=
-sponsored studies and judgments.=94

                Dr. Benbrook concludes his blog by writing, =93Deep passion=
s now swirl around GE crop or food issues, creating a climate where it is h=
ard to thoughtfully assess tradeoffs and reach agreement on where more scie=
nce and field monitoring is needed.  Unfortunately, the well of science sup=
porting today=92s GE foods and technology is surprisingly shallow and incre=
asingly toxic, and that must change, both to thoughtfully deploy agricultur=
al biotechnology and regain public trust in our regulatory system.=94

                Until we can thoughtfully assess the tradeoffs  I believe C=
NB ranchers can feel good about providing our customers the option of beef =
that is feedlot finished with non-GMO feed.  At the same time we need to re=
search the feasibility of providing a non-GMO for the life-of-the-animal pr=
oduct.

                In the meantime, do good work, keep your Bogs and Mucks pat=
ched and remember =96 CNB=92s a work in progress.





Dr. Benbrook, at a time convenient to you I would sure like to visit with y=
ou and get your thoughts on various aspects of GMO and non-GMO feeds and fo=
ods.



Sincerely,

Jack Southworth
