Pierre, Susan --

Just read the neonic seed treatment paper in PLOS ONE by Main et al.  Citie=
s St. Pierre's work.

I was struck by the differences in soil half-lives =97 385 days in Ontario,=
 but 1386 days in North Dakota??? Pretty big difference, do you suppose the=
re is, in part, a methodological explanation.

I wish the paper had more to say re risk at the levels measured in praire p=
othole.
