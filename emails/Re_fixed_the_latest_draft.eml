        Excellent, I wish I had your level of Word skills.

        Pete, you have the ball, and will be making a number of changes.  W=
hen you are done, resave the draft and send it to whoever you want to work =
on it next.  Hopefully by limiting the movement of chunks of text from vari=
ous versions into the master, we will not recreate the problems.

 I also added references where I could decipher which study was cited. Ther=
e are a lot of areas that need references to be added. I'll add them as peo=
ple provide them.
