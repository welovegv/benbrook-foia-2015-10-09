        The funding I have in hand that could support some glyphosate testi=
ng is from a foundation that will expect to see some results published in t=
he foreseeable future.  Given the difficulty my program has had raising $$,=
 I have to sow a return on investment as soon as possible.  Can this testin=
g be done in a way that would produce a publishable paper, perhaps just pre=
senting preliminary data in support of a hypothesis?
