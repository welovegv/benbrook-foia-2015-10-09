        Cliff =97

        Hope all is well.  New babies in the barn, some coats slipping, som=
e still maybe on track.

        I checked out the route, Mapquest projects 28 hours, which means we=
 will make it in about 25, I am guessing.

        I think we will be fine if we leave mid-morning on Thursday.  You c=
an drive over in the early a.m., or come the night before =97 your call.

        How many rabbits are you planning on bringing, and what dimensions =
are your travel cages?  I am sure we=92ll have ample space, but I am starti=
ng to think through the packing strategy.

                Chuck
