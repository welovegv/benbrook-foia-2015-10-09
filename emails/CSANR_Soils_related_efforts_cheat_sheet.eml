Chuck,



As promised, here is a quick and dirty cheat sheet description of major are=
as of emphasis for sustainable / organic ag soils work at WSU.



1.       WSU Cook Agronomy Farm Long-Term Agroecological Research (LTAR) Si=
te

Lead: Dave Huggins (Technically USDA ARS, but Affiliate Faculty in Crops & =
Soils / CSANR)

Production System Focus: Palouse region, dryland cereal production system

Website: http://css.wsu.edu/facilities/cook/

Thrust of activity: Established ~2000, Cook Farm is the most instrumented a=
nd studied research farm in the US Pacific Northwest and recently received =
USDA ARS designation in the first round of the LTAR site competition. Both =
near-term applied producer problem solving and long-term agroecosystem rese=
arch are combined on this farm. It is managed with continuous no-till using=
 field scale equipment. It is THE HUB of cereal production research activit=
y in the Inland PNW, with dozens of students and faculty utilizing it for r=
esearch that ranges from climate / trace gas emissions / carbon, to hydrolo=
gy, to agronomy, to precision ag. It has a substantial focus on understandi=
ng the implications and interactions of management, environment and soils. =
Literally tens of millions of dollars of extramural research investment has=
 been made in this facility through competitive grants over the past 15 yea=
rs. It was the key farm site for the Paul G. Allen Foundation funded Climat=
e Friendly Farming Project.

Bottom line: Cook is the single best managed and studied research farm in t=
he region - with good leadership, good management, good teams of faculty an=
d students, good instrumentation, a massive database of agronomic, economic=
 and environmental variables, a tremendous amount of publications being gen=
erated.



2.       Puyallup Long-term Organic site / West-side organic research effor=
ts

Lead: Historically Craig Cogger (retiring in early 2015), transitioning to =
Doug Collins

Production System Focus: Organic vegetable / forage rotations

Thrust of Activity: The certified organic production trials were establishe=
d in the early 2000's and are the longest running certified organic researc=
h site in the region. The treatments that were established were a vegetable=
 /forage / pasture production rotation that is applicable to many small, di=
versified organic farms on the west side. Basic data is collected annual of=
 the maintained site and targeted experiments and data-collection are condu=
cted using extramural funds. The goal of the site is to have a long-term, o=
rganically managed site that can be used to understand the implications of =
long-term organic management on soils and other factors. Numerous additiona=
l studies ranging from cover cropping, compost use, organic-no-till, trace =
gas emissions, carbon sequestration, nutrient management, precision ag for =
small farms, etc. have all been conducted.

Bottom Line: This site doesn't have the resources or the number of faculty =
/ students that the Cook Farm largely due to the distance from Pullman, but=
 none-the-less it is a fantastic resource that is getting to the point wher=
e really meaningful studies and evaluations of soil quality are being condu=
cted.



3.       Soil amendment efforts

Lead(s): various including Hal Collins (USDA ARS), Lynne Carpenter-Boggs, D=
oug Collins, David Granatstein, Andy McGuire, Craig Frear, Mark Mazzola (US=
DA ARS), Claudio Stockle

Production System Focus: Various including tree fruit, small diversified or=
ganic, large organic vegetable production systems, dryland cereals, dairy, =
municipal compost systems

Thrust of Activity: This is perhaps the most difficult to put a finger on, =
but there are a large number of faculty that have managed experiments, site=
s or technology focused on producing, using and assessing the impacts of or=
ganically derived amendments on soils. The single largest body of work was =
managed by Hal Collins (was ARS in Prosser, just relocated to Texas) and wa=
s centered around CSANR's long-term efforts in Climate Friendly Farming and=
 Waste 2 Fuels. Hal ran probably a dozen different large experimental studi=
es looking at dozens of amendments evaluating for carbon and nutrient impac=
ts, soil quality characteristics, trace gas emissions, disease, etc. Lynne =
is probably the second major player here - with perhaps 1/3 the number of s=
tudies conducted. Mazzola may have made the most sophisticated advances in =
the use of designer soil amendments for disease management (brassica seed m=
eals).

Bottom line: We have a lot of expertise that is interested and working in t=
he area of soil amendments. This is a difficult area of work to fund (you h=
ave to have a really unique angle or federal programs just won't bite), but=
 in many ways might be the most 'in demand' from farmers.



4.       Cover-cropping efforts

Lead(s): Andy McGuire, David Granatstein, Doug Collins

Production System Focus: irrigated field crops, tree fruit, small scale div=
ersified vegetables

Thrust of Activity: The driving focus of this work is to understand how to =
manage cover crops to maximize benefits to farmers, soil quality, and speci=
fically disease suppression. The two big plays here are mustard green manur=
es and orchard floor management - long term efforts of Andy and David speci=
fically.

Bottom line: The focus of this work has been driven by more of our extensio=
n personnel rather than research personnel over the long-run, though more r=
esearch scientists are getting involved.



5.       Miscellaneous suppressive soils efforts

Lead(s): Lindsay du Toit, Scot Hulbert, Tim Paulitz, Mark Mazzola, Lynne Ca=
rpenter-Boggs, Andy McGuire

Production System Focus: vegetable seed, cereals, tree fruit, potatoes / ve=
getables

Thrust of Activity: There is a lot of overlap between this cluster of effor=
t and others on the list, including soil amendments, cover crops, Cook Farm=
, etc. However, I think what makes this effort worthy of it's own line-item=
 is that the focus of this group of people / activities is less on the spec=
ific site or management practice and more on the question of "can we manage=
 to improve soil suppression of disease". Their work ranges from genetics t=
o cropping systems to cover crops / amendments to inoculation approaches to=
 boosting soil suppression of disease.

Bottom line: THERE IS REAL SCIENTIFIC HORSEPOWER IN THIS GROUP. In terms of=
 meaningful scientific discoveries that can be applied by growers across ma=
ny production systems (here and globally) to use soil quality to manage pla=
nt disease, this group is likely over-looked nationally and internationally=
. This group of scientists are not self-promoters at all and each lives wit=
h one foot in the basic / molecular sciences world and the other foot in th=
e applied, solve-farmers-problems world.



6.       Linkages between soils and fruit nutrition

Leads: Amit Dinghra, Shyam Sablani, Girish Ganjyal, Preston Andrews, Regano=
ld

Production System Focus: tree fruit, soft fruits

Thrust of Activity: This work has largely been exploratory and one-off stud=
ies, though Amit, Shyam, and Girish are all trying to make this one of the =
main foci of their labs. While Reganold gets the external publicity in this=
 area, it's my opinion (shared by many others) that Amit and Shyam are the =
real horsepower behind WSU's potential for discoveries - due to their molec=
ular capabilities and tools.

Bottom line: We've had a couple of "big splash" papers authored by Reganold=
 / Andrews, but the real value proposition is the younger faculty that have=
 the molecular tools to really answer some of the more complex questions.



7.       Throwing a bone to IBC (Institute for Biological Chemistry)

Leads: Currently Interim Director is John Browse, but search is underway. A=
lso, Mike Kahn.

Production System Focus: Basic Plant Sciences

Thrust of Activity: IBC is what is often thought of as CAHNRS' "genetic eng=
ineering group", though that is actually quite misleading. We have several =
"GE faculty" that are not part of IBC and many IBC scientists study non-GE =
applications. The really interesting efforts from IBC that fit the "soil qu=
ality" theme are the studies around symbiotic interactions between plants a=
nd microbes (rhizobial or soil-borne). Probably the most notable is Mike Ka=
hn's long-term investigations into plant-microbe relationships that affect =
N fixation. However, others have been branching out into the area of plant =
defense as well.

Bottom line: This group is easy to overlook when thinking about soil qualit=
y, but many of the best projects we've funded with BIOAg money have include=
d an IBC scientist / affiliate working with a soils / plant path faculty me=
mber to apply a molecular insight to a real-world problem.

<p class=3D"MsoListParagraph">Thrust of Activity: There is a lot of overlap=
 between this cluster of effort and others on the list, including soil amen=
dments, cover crops, Cook Farm, etc. However, I think what makes this effor=
t worthy of it&#8217;s own line-item is
 that the focus of this group of people / activities is less on the specifi=
c site or management practice and more on the question of &#8220;can we man=
age to improve soil suppression of disease&#8221;. Their work ranges from g=
enetics to cropping systems to cover crops /
 amendments to inoculation approaches to boosting soil suppression of disea=
se.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoListParagraph">Bottom line: THERE IS REAL SCIENTIFIC HORSEPO=
WER IN THIS GROUP. In terms of meaningful scientific discoveries that can b=
e applied by growers across many production systems (here and globally) to =
use soil quality to manage plant disease,
 this group is likely over-looked nationally and internationally. This grou=
p of scientists are not self-promoters at all and each lives with one foot =
in the basic / molecular sciences world and the other foot in the applied, =
solve-farmers-problems world.

<p class=3D"MsoListParagraph">Thrust of Activity: This work has largely bee=
n exploratory and one-off studies, though Amit, Shyam, and Girish are all t=
rying to make this one of the main foci of their labs. While Reganold gets =
the external publicity in this area,
 it&#8217;s my opinion (shared by many others) that Amit and Shyam are the =
real horsepower behind WSU&#8217;s potential for discoveries &#8211; due to=
 their molecular capabilities and tools.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoListParagraph">Bottom line: We&#8217;ve had a couple of &#82=
20;big splash&#8221; papers authored by Reganold / Andrews, but the real va=
lue proposition is the younger faculty that have the molecular tools to rea=
lly answer some of the more complex questions.
