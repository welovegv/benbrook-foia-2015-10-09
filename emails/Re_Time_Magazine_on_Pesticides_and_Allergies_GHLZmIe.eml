Chuck:

Did you see this article/blog piece by Time today? Any idea how often organ=
ic farmers are using streptomycin on their farmers compared to conventional=
 farmers. A fellow RD pointed this out to me. She is someone who appears to=
 go out of her way to critique organic farming practices.


"On another note, this article was in the Time blog today. It is about pest=
icides causing allergies and specifically mentioned streptomycin. I just wa=
nted to point out to the group, and this was not mentioned in the article, =
that in the US streptomycin is OMRI listed and thus is allowed in organic p=
roduction."
