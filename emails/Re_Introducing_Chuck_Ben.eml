   Hi Chuck and Ben,

   Wanted to introduce you two over email.

   Chuck, per our discussion Ben has been working 20 hours a week for the p=
ast two weeks. He has been key in putting together some of the pesticide re=
sidue data and in getting new data for the seeds paper. He has also compile=
d a thorough list of links that need to be fixed in the M2M web site. He ne=
eds to go through all of the paperwork necessary to get him paid.

   Ben, Chuck is the leader of the Measure 2 Manage project at WSU. Hopeful=
ly you'll get to meet him soon. He's a great person to work for and with (a=
nd I'm not just saying that because I work for him).

   Ben, in a separate email can you send me your time-tracking excel sheet?=
 I'll look it over and discuss with you, and we'll submit to Chuck. In the =
future you'll just submit directly to him.

   Thanks. Hope you guys get to meet in person soon.
   Nick
