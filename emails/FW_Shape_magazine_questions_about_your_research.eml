Subject: Shape magazine: questions about your research


Dr. Benbrook:

Hello! I'm an editor at SHAPE magazine, a national health and fitness magaz=
ine. I'm interested in covering your fascinating study, "Organic Production=
 Enhances Milk Nutritional Quality by Shifting Fatty Acid Composition."

I had a few quick questions about your research that I'm hoping you could a=
nswer. Would you happen to have a few moments to chat about your research? =
Or, if you prefer, we could correspond by e-mail; my questions follow.

1. In your analysis of roughly 400 samples of organic and conventional milk=
, you found that organic milk contains about 62 percent more omega-3 fats t=
han conventional milk =97 with a total of 0.0321 grams of omega-3s per 100 =
grams of milk. Organic milk also contained 25 percent less omega-6s than co=
nvention risk. Is this accurate?

2. Why is this the case =97 is it because organic cows eat grass instead of=
 corn-based feed?

3. To put it in perspective, is milk a good source of omega-3s; does it con=
tain the same level as other omega-3-rich foods, like flax?

4. In the study, you mention that choosing organic dairy products can help =
the ratio of omega 3s to 6s =97 towards the 2.3 goal. Why is this important=
?

5. The omega-3s are found in the fat of milk, so choosing organic skim milk=
 products won't have the same benefits. Is that accurate? For people who ar=
e watching their calorie count, would reduced-fat dairy products be a good =
option?

6. Finally, please spell your name and title as you would like it to appear=
 in print.

Because of deadlines, I'd be so grateful if you could respond as soon as po=
ssible.

Thanks in advance for your time and help!

Warmly,
Sharon
