        Jim =97

        I had planned on getting an =93emerging priorities=94 proposal into=
 you, but have been swamped with travel/other tasks.  I had a chat with Cha=
d re three big ticket issues that WSU should try to get more involved with.=
  Chad suggested I summarize them in an email to you, and possibly follow u=
p with a meeting, if you want to explore the ideas more fully.

        These are issues/challenges that are going to attract substantial n=
ew research investments in the near-term (next 5 years).  Given the current=
 stage of M2M program evolution, our modest budget, and a staff of 2, it is=
 not feasible for me to put together the kind of team required to go after =
any of these opportunities, but I surely can contribute in a serious way if=
 others are making such a move.

1. Soil health.  The Soil Renaissance project is about 18 months old, and m=
ay be the effort that finally breaks through the various constraints holdin=
g back a serious increase in investments in promoting soil health.  The Nob=
el Foundation, Farm Foundation, and Howard Buffett Foundation are behind th=
e effort.  They are about 6-12 months from having their full recommended pr=
ogram done and launched.  The expectation is that once this milestone is re=
ached, the Buffett Foundation+Gates+Noble Foundations will announce a major=
 new investment fund to jump-start the work both here and internationally. =
 Figures like $500 million have been thrown around, and would clearly be in=
 the ballpark for anything that Bill Gates and Warren+Howard Buffett would =
call a =93big=94 investment.
As will all such soil-focused efforts, the remaining hurdles are how to mea=
sure soil health, establish a baseline, set goals, and monitor progress.  I=
 have been involved because of my long-term interest in measuring soil qual=
ity.  There are four task forces moving the work along; I am on the measure=
ment task force, and it meets mid-Nov in Oklahoma, at the Nobel Foundation =
headquarters.  The full group meets 12/3, a meeting I will miss, since I de=
bate Bob Fraley of Monsanto that evening in a NYC =93Intelligence Squared=
=94 debate. Obviously, no one knows how this will evolve, but I see a huge =
opportunity for WSU here, given the depth of the WSU bench on these issues.

2. Food safety.  I was in DC for several days in Sept., and the word is the=
re is going to be some substantial new investments by FDA, secondarily by U=
SDA, in food safety related research to establish a credible science based =
for setting details of evolving FSMA regs.  The biggest issues all involve =
the interface of crop farming, livestock/manure/compost, water quality, foo=
d safety.  The needs/interests of small farmers and organic farmers will be=
 given considerable focus in much of this work.  I have several friends in =
DC that will be closely involved with the shaping of these research program=
s, and have been advised (in one case "begged=94) to get involved.  I also =
have very close ties to IEH (Seattle-based micro testing company), a huge h=
uge player in this evolving area (and then there is also Bill Mahler, who c=
an move mountains in this arena).  I could see the PNW emerging as the regi=
on driving much of the cutting edge work.  But again, I cannot do it from m=
y current base.

3. Dealing with GE ag issues/problems.  There are huge issues/challenges ar=
ising in the wake of problems with current GE crops.  These problems are mo=
st acute in the SE and midwest, and are not really issues in the PNW.  Ther=
e are reasons land grants and scientists therein from the impacted areas ge=
nerally stay away from these issues.  If WSU has the will to take them on, =
there will be substantial funding to support needed work.  I will be doing =
some via the M2M program. I have heard there are a few other key things goi=
ng on, or in the planning stages (e.g., glyphosate testing in breastmilk). =
 This is an area crying out for a focused effort at a major land grant, or =
perhaps a consortia of land grants.  If such a team/consortia came together=
, it is certain new research funds will find there way to it.

        Hope all is well, looking forward to hearing from you.

                Chuck
