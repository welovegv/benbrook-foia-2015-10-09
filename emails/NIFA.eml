Hello Chuck,



Thanks for letting me know about the proposal. That is too bad we were not =
funded, but it is nice to have some strong ideas in place for future submis=
sions.



I am making some progress on my analysis of land use footprint of pasture-b=
ased dairying, and would be interested to hear your thoughts at some point.



Hope you are doing well,

Bad news below, our proposal only rated "medium" priority. I guess I am not=
 surprised, but I am disappointed.



Perhaps we should regroup and submit to a foundation.

Dear Dr. Benbrook,

Thank you for submitting your proposed project to the Organic Transitions (=
ORG) competitive grants program of the USDA National Institute of Food and =
Agriculture (NIFA).  Within this program area funding was available to supp=
ort only 19% of the proposals submitted during the current funding cycle.  =
We regret that the program is unable to provide funding for your proposed p=
roject this year.

We are continuing efforts to make awards that are meaningful in terms of du=
ration and funds awarded.  However, the overall quality of proposals has in=
creased and the competition is aggressive for the limited funds available.

The review panel members carefully evaluated your proposal.  These panel me=
mbers and reviewers are subject matter experts selected for their knowledge=
 of your field.  Your proposal was evaluated on scientific merit, qualifica=
tions of project personnel and adequacy of facilities, and relevance to lon=
g-range improvements in organic agriculture.

Please note:  Projects rated Low Priority were determined to be ineligible =
for funding as currently submitted though the idea is consistent with the p=
rogram priorities.  Projects ranked as Do Not Fund are not recommended for =
resubmission in their current form, although some merit may have been found=
 in the proposal.  Please refer to the enclosed relative ranking sheet for =
the ranking of your proposal.

Please direct any questions you may have to:

Proposal Number: 2014-03395     Project Director: Benbrook

Proposal Title: Identifying Cost-Effective Options to Enhance the Performan=
ce and Resiliency of Organic Dairy Farms Heavily Reliant on Forage-Based Fe=
eds

Positive Aspects of the Proposal
Reviewers felt that this proposal had a clear grasp of a primary stakeholde=
r concern and presented a reasonable set of objectives for addressing the c=
oncern(s) that was(were) identified.  PI qualifications are sound and prior=
 work record and engagement with organic stakeholders is a plus.

Negative Aspects of the Proposal
Reviewers had concerns that the methodology was excessively focused on a si=
ngle modeling technique.  One reviewer desired greater detail on the method=
ology for estimation of GHG emissions and C sequestration.  Therefore, ulti=
mate benefit to stakeholders including farmers was difficult to assess with=
 confidence.  The panel noted that the connection to the 2014 RFA needed to=
 be more clearly addressed..  Excessive use of unfamiliar acronyms made thi=
s proposal difficult to read.

Synthesis Comments
Overall a reasonable proposal but the extreme focus on modeling left review=
ers unconvinced of tangible benefit to stakeholders.Reviewers suggested tha=
t the team consider adding a soil scientist and also consider linking the S=
OG model to a regional climate model to help quantify frequency and likelih=
ood of episodic disturbances in dairy feed and forage supply.

This is a very well-considered proposal to address what is the core challen=
ge for the majority of organic dairy farmers in the United States:  how to =
optimize on-farm forage production.  Successfully tackling this challenge i=
s essential for so many critical aspects of overall farm viability, includi=
ng herd health, productivity, environmental stewardship, and profitability.=
  This proposal would employ a survey-style approach by identifying fifty t=
o sixty organic dairy farms from three distinct eco-regions (Northeast, Upp=
er Midwest, Pacific Northwest) which would be the source for extensive data=
 including details of management practices, milk quality, herd health and l=
ongevity, feed quality, greenhouse gas emissions and economics.  The applic=
ant would develop modeling tools and techniques capable of integrating thes=
e diverse data sets into a comprehensive analysis of overall dairy performa=
nce.  This is an extremely ambitious proposal in terms of data collection a=
nd manipulation but the P.I. and his principal collaborators have demonstra=
ble expertise (including comparable modeling work) in organic dairy systems=
.  There is clear outreach and connection to organic dairy farmers, not so =
much on an individual basis but through organizations like the CROPP Cooper=
ative which certainly represent a large number of producers.  A secondary o=
bjective of this proposal is the development of on-farm tools for complianc=
e with the National Organic Program=92s pasture requirements for organic ru=
minants.  Again, it=92s an extremely ambitious proposal but one based on a =
fundamental reality =96 especially for family-scale dairy farms =96 that op=
timizing forage efficiency is critical to overall performance.


___________________________________________________________________________=

This project proposes to study forage based diaries and the impact of the f=
orages on cost and return.  They plan to survey 50-60 long term organic dai=
ries with approximately equal numbers from three regions of the country, No=
rtheast, Northwest, and upper Midwest.  Forage and milk samples will be tak=
en as well as cow health information for analysis.  Modeling will be develo=
ped to determine forage quality, reproductive performance, and cow longevit=
y based on these forage based systems.  It is hoped that the data and model=
ing systems will allow producers to understand the most cost effective ways=
 to manage forages to cost effective return.

The information will be disseminated in typical publication and producer se=
minars.   Discussion regarding evaluation are a little weak, relying of sem=
inar and workshop participation.

The assembled PD=92s are adequate for the successful completion of this wor=
k which should be able to be completed according to the time line presented=
.

Overall the proposal is well written, explains the project well and has ade=
quate justification.


___________________________________________________________________________=
_________________________

Excessive use of acronyms made this proposal difficult to read at times and=
 it appears not to have followed format for this RFA, nor was there any men=
tion of priorities in the 2014 RFA which makes me suspect it was redeployed=
 from a previous submission elsewhere. After reviewing it, I think the subj=
ect matter could have fit the 2014 RFA well if refocused and presented alte=
rnatively.

This proposal addresses a key issue for the organic dairy industry in a geo=
graphically diverse manner, based on collection of real farm data to develo=
p their model.

This proposal would have benefitted by 1) better describing the Extension c=
omponent and possibly including an Education component, 2) writing specific=
ally to the 2014 ORG RFA, 3) providing detail on how GHG gases and C seques=
tration will be measured/estimated, 4) including a monitoring and evaluatio=
n plan, 5) considering adding relevant soil science expertise to the resear=
ch team, 6) consider engaging a regional climate model to help quantify the=
 episodic nature of feed and forage shortages, 7) engage partners that coul=
d help deliver the SOG model, and 8) better describe stakeholder involvemen=
t relative to the SOG model (daily contact was avowed but how will that con=
tact be organized across such a broad region?)

Program: Organic Transitions<br>
Proposal Number: 2014-03395<br>
Proposal Title: Identifying Cost-Effective Options to Enhance the Performan=

<br>
Dear Dr. Benbrook,<br>
<br>
Thank you for submitting your proposed project to the Organic Transitions (=
ORG) competitive grants program of the USDA National Institute of Food and =
Agriculture (NIFA).&nbsp;&nbsp;Within this program area funding was availab=
le to support only 19% of the proposals submitted
 during the current funding cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;We regret that the program is=
 unable to provide funding for your proposed project this year.<br>
<br>
We are continuing efforts to make awards that are meaningful in terms of du=
ration and funds awarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the overall quality of propos=
als has increased and the competition is aggressive for the limited funds a=
vailable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The review panel members carefully evaluated your proposal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thes=
e panel members and reviewers are subject matter experts selected for their=
 knowledge of your field.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your proposal was evaluated on scienti=
fic merit, qualifications of project personnel and adequacy
 of facilities, and relevance to long-range improvements in organic agricul=
ture.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Please note:&nbsp;&nbsp;Projects rated Low Priority were determined to be i=
neligible for funding as currently submitted though the idea is consistent =
with the program priorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Projects ranked as Do Not Fund are =
not recommended for resubmission in their current form,
 although some merit may have been found in the proposal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please=
 refer to the enclosed relative ranking sheet for the ranking of your propo=
sal.<br>
<br>
Please direct any questions you may have to:&nbsp;<br>

Organic Transitions - PANEL SUMMARY<br>
<br>
The panel decision regarding your proposal is based on the input provided b=
y the reviews and the collected expertise and judgment of the individual pa=
nel members.&nbsp;&nbsp;This panel summary reflects the consensus opinion o=
f the panel regarding your proposal.<br>
<br>
Proposal Number: 2014-03395&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Director: =

<br>
Proposal Title: Identifying Cost-Effective Options to Enhance the Performan=
ce and Resiliency of Organic Dairy Farms Heavily Reliant on Forage-Based Fe=
eds<br>
<br>
Positive Aspects of the Proposal<br>
Reviewers felt that this proposal had a clear grasp of a primary stakeholde=
r concern and presented a reasonable set of objectives for addressing the c=
oncern(s) that was(were) identified.&nbsp;&nbsp;PI qualifications are sound=
 and prior work record and engagement with
 organic stakeholders is a plus.<br>
<br>
Negative Aspects of the Proposal<br>
Reviewers had concerns that the methodology was excessively focused on a si=
ngle modeling technique.&nbsp;&nbsp;One reviewer desired greater detail on =
the methodology for estimation of GHG emissions and C sequestration.&nbsp;&=
nbsp;Therefore, ultimate benefit to stakeholders including
 farmers was difficult to assess with confidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel note=
d that the connection to the 2014 RFA needed to be more clearly addressed..=
&nbsp;&nbsp;Excessive use of unfamiliar acronyms made this proposal difficu=
lt to read.<br>
<br>
Synthesis Comments<br>
Overall a reasonable proposal but the extreme focus on modeling left review=
ers unconvinced of tangible benefit to stakeholders.Reviewers suggested tha=
t the team consider adding a soil scientist and also consider linking the S=
OG model to a regional climate model
 to help quantify frequency and likelihood of episodic disturbances in dair=
y feed and forage supply.<br>

ns-serif; ">This is a very well-considered proposal to address what is the =
core challenge for the majority of organic dairy farmers in the United Stat=
es:&nbsp; how to optimize on-farm forage
 production.&nbsp; Successfully tackling this challenge is essential for so=
 many critical aspects of overall farm viability, including herd health, pr=
oductivity, environmental stewardship, and profitability.&nbsp; This propos=
al would employ a survey-style approach by
 identifying fifty to sixty organic dairy farms from three distinct eco-reg=
ions (Northeast, Upper Midwest, Pacific Northwest) which would be the sourc=
e for extensive data including details of management practices, milk qualit=
y, herd health and longevity, feed
 quality, greenhouse gas emissions and economics.&nbsp; The applicant would=
 develop modeling tools and techniques capable of integrating these diverse=
 data sets into a comprehensive analysis of overall dairy performance.&nbsp=
; This is an extremely ambitious proposal
 in terms of data collection and manipulation but the P.I. and his principa=
l collaborators have demonstrable expertise (including comparable modeling =
work) in organic dairy systems.&nbsp; There is clear outreach and connectio=
n to organic dairy farmers, not so much
 on an individual basis but through organizations like the CROPP Cooperativ=
e which certainly represent a large number of producers.&nbsp; A secondary =
objective of this proposal is the development of on-farm tools for complian=
ce with the National Organic Program=92s
 pasture requirements for organic ruminants.&nbsp; Again, it=92s an extreme=
ly ambitious proposal but one based on a fundamental reality =96 especially=
 for family-scale dairy farms =96 that optimizing forage efficiency is crit=
ical to overall performance.</span><span style=3D"color:black"><o:p></o:p><=
