Don,

Nic has the food-acres calculator working well for most plant-based foods f=
or which we have data.  Its time for you to take a look at it.

We are turning to the ingredients and multi-ingredient foods.  Two question=
s --


1.      Is there a quick/easy source of data re fractions (e.g., wheat, ger=
m, bran, flour) for other key grains/oilseeds? In NutriCirlces??
2.      For the multi-ingredient foods in NutriCircles, do you have the rec=
ipe data behind them, or just use USDA data reported on the food (e.g. A pi=
ece of pizza)?

Please give me a call to discuss.

Chuck
