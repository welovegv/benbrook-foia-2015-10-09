What an amazingly cool idea, I bet grazing brokers could find lots of custo=
mers in multiple states.  Thanks for the letter, it is really just right.

Hi Chuck,
Here's my letter. Let me know what you think, or if you'd like me to add or=
 change anything.

So what does a 'Grazing Broker' do? you ask...This is a project we started =
a couple of years ago.The overall goal is to preserve and protect grassland=
s on private land by engaging with non-farming landowners, who, it is estim=
ated, control about 60% of the farmland in the upper Midwest. This is a hug=
e audience that, in large part, have no engagement with the agriculture com=
munity other than the guy down the road who writes them a check for renting=
 their land. We think these folks may be sympathetic to environmental conce=
rns and may be willing to partner with conservation-minded farmers, if they=
 knew how to find them. So that's what the 'broker' does--facilitates these=
 relationships. We are targeting CRP acres that have expiring contracts and=
 trying to partner those landowners with livestock producers who can graze =
the grass and keep it from getting plowed up for corn production. We recent=
ly got a NFWF grant to fund a position for a couple of years, and I felt li=
ke it was time for a change--so here I am!

best regards, and good luck on the Organic Transitions proposal!
Laura

      I have led a team putting together an organic transitions proposal to=
 USDA focused on grass-based dairies =97 the proposal is attached.  Would y=
ou be willing to write a short support letter, perhaps mentioning your past=
 work with the Shades of Green (SOG) calculator, and your interest in seein=
g it taken to the next level.  The letter can be addressed/emailed to me.  =
FYI, I attach a support letter from George/SOV.

      Hope all is well in WI.
