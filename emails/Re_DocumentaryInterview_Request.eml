Lets do it in the winter, if there is that much time.  I will be at a cool =
conference Nov 7 in Vancouver, WA.  Other folks you should talk to will be =
there as well.

Dear Dr. Benbrook.

I appreciate your willingness to sit down and conduct an interview despite =
your busy schedule.  Would you have time between September 13th and Septemb=
er 24th?

I was headed to Seattle this coming Friday, but could rearrange my schedule=
 if necessary to meet you in Hermiston.  Also, we could postpone until this=
 Winter.  What would work best for you?

Kind Regards,
Jenson Hagen

   I am crazy busy.  Perhaps there is one option =97 I will be in Hermiston=
 this coming Saturday and Sunday at a rabbit show.  There are always blocks=
 of time open, each day, when I could sneak out an do the interview, e.g. I=
n my hotel room.  If you wanted to organize your trip back to the west side=
 over the weekend, and drive through Hermiston, that is likely the one shot=
 at getting this done.

   Hello Dr. Benbrook,

   I'm a naturopathic doctor in Portland with a prior film background and I=
'm putting together a documentary on diet and nutrition.  I would be honore=
d to sit down and discuss the recent meta-analysis published in the British=
 Journal of Nutrition that you co-authored.  You will retain full editorial=
 rights.

   This week or next week would be ideal for a brief 30-minute interview si=
nce I made plans to spend Labor Day in Spokane.  I can stick around the Inl=
and Empire a few extra days if need be.

   Kind Regards,
   Dr. Jens Hagen
