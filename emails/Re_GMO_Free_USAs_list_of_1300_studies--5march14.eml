        George --

        My experience as an expert witness in court proceedings is that
publication of research in a peer reviewed journal is very important in
responding to inevitable attacks, and questions re why the paper X reaches
conclusions different than paper Y. A new paper, plus the 2 papers and
Science letter by Domingo will be a pretty convincing body of evidence on
the issue "how well tested are GE traits and technology in general?"
