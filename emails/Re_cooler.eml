   Evening Chuck,
   I am working a bit on the cooler this afternoon, gathering information a=
nd checking things out.

   I saw it didn=92t have enough water coming in to fill the bottom of the =
cooler so I increased it a bit. Also realize that
   I need to take some tools up to change the float level so that enough wa=
ter can come in without overflowing.

   I talked with Kent and he sent me a manual that I printed out that we no=
w have. There is suppose to be a set of
   pads on the outside of the metal louvers. Now the main reason for this e=
 mail.......were they ever there?

   I am waiting for a reply back from Kent on some questions, then I will  =
be able to proceed. It looks like I will need
   to clean the distribution pipe too with a brush that they make for it.

   We are getting some thunder and rain right now. And it is suppose to rai=
n tomorrow and tomorrow night. It would
   be good if it did. Karen tells me you will be home tomorrow night  and t=
hen she is leaving the next day. Busy lives
   you two lead.

   See you when you get back.
   Red
